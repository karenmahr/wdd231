In this website you´ll find two different projects I created for my Web Frontend Development I class. From this About Me page, you can access the “Chamber of Commerce,” which is the website I have been working on throughout the semester. You can also access the “Final Project,” which was based on a free theme of my choosing, and I decided to create a Christmas-themed project. I hope you enjoy both pages!
